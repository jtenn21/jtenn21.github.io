            <h2>About</h2>
            <p>Hello all!<br><br> My name is Johnny Tennyson. I am currently a student at Bemidji State Univeristy studying CIS.
            <br>I recently took up the thought of trying to develop my own personal website. This is what I came up with...<br><br>
        Before I was a computer enthusiast, I played college basketball. <a href= https://x.com/BSUBeaversMBB/status/1743772647324860834?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw%7Ctwcamp%5Etweetembed%7Ctwterm%5E1743772647324860834%7Ctwgr%5Ecc3e43d024af3cddabf3a3d6edd615f8f1173dee%7Ctwcon%5Es1_&ref_url=https%3A%2F%2Fbsubeavers.com%2Fnews%2F2024%2F1%2F6%2Fmens-basketball-tennysons-game-winning-three-pointer-sends-beavers-past-cougars-as-sutherland-tallies-a-career-high-35-points.aspx>Here's one of the few highlights I was apart of...</a><br>As you can tell, I was
    pretty pumped. I played for two years and made some great memories.<br> I enjoyed basketball, but decided that it was time for me to hang up the jersey and focus on another passion of mine.<br>
    I am now a fully committed student with a love for technology. I was most recently awarded an outstanding CIS student<br> scholarship from the department. I look to continue my academic excellence in the classroom and plan on joining the CS club this coming year.<br>My skills include HTML, CSS, Javascript, Python and C++. <br> <br> I am currently
    in search for any internships that will allow me to learn and grow in the tech world!
